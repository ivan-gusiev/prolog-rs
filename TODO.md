### To Do
- [ ] compile: fix FlatRef, see if possible to optimize
- [ ] more compiler tests
- [ ] static type system?
- [ ] name table, so we can support more than 1 character in our names
- [ ] roll my own topological sort
- [ ] a symbol table that doesn't repeat the same word twice
- [ ] fix Clippy warnings
- [ ] parse_* functions should take a mut ref to symboltable, instead of doing the in-out dance

### Done âœ“
- [x] WAM assembly parser
- [x] Prolog query parser 
- [x] seems that integration tests are not working (fixed)
- [x] justfile instead of makefile
- [x] golden parameterized tests: show input as well as output
